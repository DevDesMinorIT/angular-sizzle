# Angular-Sizzle

Angular.js internally uses jqLite for working with the DOM, a micro-library similar to jQuery but much smaller. As Angular has its own AJAX-implementation and provides animations (version >= 1.1.3), there's actually no real need for jQuery.

Only when it comes to selecting DOM-elements, using just jqLite can become quite a hassle. That's the point where Angular-Sizzle comes into play. It provides the powerful selector-capability of jQuery without the huge AJAX- and animation-overload.

To demonstrate the difference:

Sizzle 1.9.4 (~18 kb) **vs** jQuery 1.10.0 (~92 kb)

## How to use?

The current version of Sizzle.js (v1.9.3) is included, so you only have to include Angular.js and Angular-Sizzle.js. Then, when instantiating your app, include 'ek.Sizzle' as a dependency.

	<script src="path/to/angular.js"></script>
	<script src="path/to/angular-sizzle-0.0.3.min.js"></script>
	<script>
		var app = angular.module('tehApp', ['ek.Sizzle']);
	</script>

That's it!

## What happens?

Angular-Sizzle saves a reference to the `angular.element`-method and overwrites it with a custom function, that takes a selector-string and passes a Sizzle-instance to the actual `angular.element`-method.

## What else?

Due to the concept of Angular, heavy DOM-lifting stuff is done by directives, which provide element-, class- and attribute-selectors in a rather abstract way. Inside of these directives one has access to an `angular.element`-instance of the relevant DOM-element to work with.

So check, if you really need a full-grown selector-engine. Maybe the use of directives and the `angular.element`-DOM-traversing-method suffices your needs.

## How to test?

There are some tests provided. To run them you need [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.8/index.html). Install it by entering the following into your console:

	npm install -g karma

After that you have the Karma Testrunner installed. Now you can run the tests by entering the following line into your console:

	karma start karma.conf.js --single-run

Everything should hopefully pass the test â€¦

## Who made this little Angular-Sizzle-Intermezzo?

Well, me. And as chance would have it, I have a twitter and a blog. Funny, hein?!

No problem!
